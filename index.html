          <p class="text-small">
            The concept of traditional education has changed radically within
            the last couple of years. Being physically present in a classroom
            isn’t the only learning option anymore — not with the rise of the
            internet and new technologies, at least. Nowadays, you have access
            to a quality education whenever and wherever you want, as long as
            you can get online. We are now entering a new era — the revolution
            of online education.

          Online learning involves courses offered by primary institutions that
          are 1% virtual, excluding massively open online courses (MOOCs).
          Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is
          contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar school
          building. It is the newest development in distance education that
          began in the mid-1990s with the spread of the internet and the World
          Wide Web. Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may also
          incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions
          utilize a Learning Management System for the administration of online
          courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital
          technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue to transform as
          well.

          The first correspondence courses began in the 1800s using parcel post
          to reach students who couldn't be on a university campus. By the early
          1900s, communication technologies improved and distance education took
          to the radio waves. In 1919 professors at the University of Wisconsin
          began an amateur radio station, becoming the first licensed radio
          station dedicated to educational broadcasting. Soon after, access to
          higher education was again expanded through the invention of the
          television; giving birth to what was known as the telecourse. The
          University of Iowa began to experiment with television for educational
          purposes in the 1930s. It was not until the 1950s, when the FCC began
          to reserve television frequencies for educational purposes, that
          telecourses caught the attention of the public. The value of
          television for education was furthered by the establishment of the
          Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) in 1967. The CPB mission was
          "to encourage the growth and development of public radio and
          television broadcasting, including the use of such media for
          instructional, educational, and cultural purposes". Online learning
          emerged in 1982 when the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute in La
          Jolla, California opened its School of Management and Strategic
          Studies. The School employed computer conferencing to deliver a
          distance education program to business executives. In 1989 the
          University of Phoenix began offering education programs through the
          internet. In 1993 with the debut of the first Internet web browser,
          created by the University of Illinois, online learning began to
          flourish. In 1998, the first fully online programs were founded: New
          York University Online, Western Governor's University, the California
          Virtual University and Trident University International.

          Online Credentials In Online Education
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Online credentials for learning are digital credentials that are
          offered in place of traditional paper credentials for a skill or
          educational achievement. Directly linked to the accelerated
          development of internet communication technologies, the development of
          digital badges, electronic passports and massive open online courses
          (MOOCs) have a very direct bearing on our understanding of learning,
          recognition and levels as they pose a direct challenge to the status
          quo. It is useful to distinguish between three forms of online
          credentials: Test-based credentials, online badges, and online
          certificates.
